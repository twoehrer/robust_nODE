Neural ODEs with time-dependent parameters for supervised learning.
Code for the papers "Large-time asymptotics in deep learning" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02491) and "Sparse approximation in learning via neural ODEs" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13566).

To be improved:
- Weight clipping for complex networks
- Time-dependent weights for non-uniform time-stepping
